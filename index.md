<h2> Details about the Match </h2>
<p> We are here for the moment everyone has been waiting for,
 The finals of the 2021 season of IPL! The match is played at UAE Dubai International stadium! A title-seeking KKR go against a stunning CSK.
 This will be a crucial win for the Punjab Kings if they win. The Chennai Super Kings' captain Ms Dhoni vs KKR captain Eoin Morgan.
 After a comeback from their poor form, CSK defeated the Delhi Capitals in the Qualifier 1 and make their way to the finals. While KKR took it steady and defeated their opponents one by one : Eesaala Cup Namde, gone. This is New Delhi, Gone!
 and now they come to face the one and only, Chennai Super Kings.
 Ruturaj Gaikwad is on his way to snatch the orange cap from KL Rahul and Faf accompanies him on his journey to be the youngest player to earn the Orange cap.
 Raina still isn't included on the playing 11 while Russel still faces his injuries
 . On the other hand, the fantastic youngsters: Varun Chakravarthy and Venkatesh Iyer continue their fabulous perfomance and Eoin Morgan still is out of form. 
 Sunil Narine has also gained a lot of supporters for his fantabulous form in the death overs. Meanwhile in CSK, Jadeja's fielding perfomance has increased a lot and Moeen Ali has regained his form. 
 This will be the match that everyone waited for! Varun chakravarthy versus Faf Du Plessis! Ruturaj Gaikwad versus Sunil Narine! Venkatesh Iyer versus Deepak Chahar and many more experienced and young players.
I personally am a fan of CSK and want them to win but who knows, it's the finals and anything can happen! Until then #Yellove and #Anbudenlions
